The song that easily comes to mind is D’banj’s top of the world, no be my fault, na so e be for me. Facebook took me back in time to 2015 where I shared an excerpt of the lyrics of the second verse on my page. The year has been a lot, however, I do not regret the decisions made and the resulting outcome. Could I have made better decisions? I don’t think so, I didn’t know any better, and the resulting outcome of some of those decisions are what would comprise my year in review.

I had intended to dedicate a paragraph to each month, but that would be a whole lot of things to read. I do not intend to bore you out with uninteresting details, but 2020 was the year I felt every bit of emotions and even more, to some of what I felt, I don’t yet have a name for. The year broke me, and in the different shards of myself, it became clearer what I hold most dear to my heart.
