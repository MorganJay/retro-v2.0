It’s 2:50 am and I am back to writing a really long read. I had started this article just before Christmas but several life-changing events overwhelmed me. I am finishing it now, with a twist maybe. I tried sleeping just after my call with Defayo that ended a few minutes past 8 pm. After an hour of tossing, I finally found some sleep, 1 hour later I was up. Picked my phone scrolled through Twitter, checked my WhatsApp messages, dragged my feet to the bathroom and back to bed. Another attempt at trying to sleep, but this time with more struggle than the last.

To be honest, it was an interesting year for me. In several ways that I hadn’t imagined. They were ups and lows but none broke me as much as the last stroke at the end of the year.
