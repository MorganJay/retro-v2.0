When I first thought of writing this, I asked myself why? “What exactly are you trying to achieve with this?” I didn’t have an answer, but I started writing it anyway. It was almost when I was done writing that I figured out an answer.

I’m writing this as a way to remind myself in the future of how tough this year was, and how hope and gratitude are all I feel as the year comes to an end.

Hope, because I really hope that this pandemic and everything it came with goes away soon, and gratitude because despite everything that happened this year, I still found a way to remain positive, make good memories, and push forward as always.
