Writing my annual review has been a rite of passage into the new year for me. And thinking about my life especially for the first ten days of every calendar year before my birthday on the 11th of January is a subconscious thing too.

Just like every other form of activity we do in life, this is for me. Not writing because I want you to read (that a plus) but because I have to write for me, esp. for future me when the bio-harddisk (the brain) gets too fragmented and starts failing.
