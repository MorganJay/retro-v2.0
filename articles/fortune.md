I remember crossover night last year, going out to look at the fireworks abi bangers (light pollution‚ùó), taking images and smiling. Next, I remember setting goals for Q1 with Geektutor and other people of culture. Twas a great way to kick things off.

January started with a bang. Wildfires and WW3 memes kicked things off. Whilst laughing at these, I began restructuring my machine learning path. I had previously jumped into deep learning and found it a little bit confusing. I also started planning my leadership journey. The year before I was elected as the Vice President of NSChE, my department's student society and the Head of Partnership of the Shell Eco-marathon Team UNILAG. It's funny that I actually thought that will be the peak of my leadership escapade this year. I also applied to CERN and the Millennium Fellowship around this time. Only the latter was successful.
