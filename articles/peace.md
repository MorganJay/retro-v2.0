In her presidential campaign last year, Kamala Harris pitched herself as a history-making candidate who could appeal to both progressives and moderates. Rather than trying to upend the economy, her policies sought incremental, targeted results, particularly focusing on historically marginalized groups like women, people of color and low-income Americans.

Her sharp debate skills and affable personality made her a top-tier contender in the early stages of the primary race. But her oscillations between policy positions resulted in damaging news cycles, and she dropped out of the race as her campaign ran out of money.
