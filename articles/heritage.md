If I were to describe 2020 in one word, it would be 'wins'. At the end of 2019, I was a tech newbie. I was struggling with materials and courses; I had little belief in myself. It seemed like I was underqualified for every opportunity I came across.

I started learning Front-end Development because I was told and I thought it was easy. When I got introduced to the languages required at a Bootcamp I enrolled in, I was so unserious and only wanted the certification. My knowledge of HTML and CSS was shallow. I had opportunities to attend events, and at every event, I felt more lost.
