Honestly, I was feeling too lazy to write a year in review but then again it occurred to me that I haven’t really written anything this year aside from my weekly journals which I didn’t publish because it’s personal.

Losing my dad to cancer on November 20th of 2019 really hit me hard. I wished I was there by his bedside when it happened, I wished I had spent more time with him in his final days or maybe if I became a doctor like he wanted me to, I would have saved him. All sorts of thoughts ran through my mind.

I bottled all the pain into this year, pretending to be fine but even hard guy dey hide cry sometime. 2 months later, and I was still struggling to be productive at work. I really needed to clear my head and luckily it was time for the annual SMW Lagos so I felt it would be great to kill two birds with one stone.
